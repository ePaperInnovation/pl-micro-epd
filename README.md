How To Use

### Installation


### Example: Hello World!

This is the [first](https://github.com/plasticlogic/pl-micro-epd/blob/master/examples/simpletest.py), and shortest possible demo and shows how to address the ePaper: 
This is the [first](https://github.com/plasticlogic/pl-micro-epd/blob/master/examples/simpletest.py), and shortest possible demo and shows how to address the ePaper: 

```cpp
#import digitalio
import busio
import board
from pl_uc8156 import PL_UC8156

# define the pins we will need
clk = board.SCK                             # clock
mosi = board.MOSI                           # MOSI
miso = board.MISO                           # MISO
cs = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D5)       # chip-select
rst = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D12)     # reset
busy = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D9)     # busy

# create the spi-device
spi = busio.SPI(clock = clk, MOSI = mosi, MISO = miso)

# give them all to our driver
display = PL_UC8156(spi = spi, cs_pin = cs, rst_pin = rst, busy_pin = busy)

display.begin(reset = False)
display.text(string = 'Hello world!', x = 1, y = 1, color = BLACK, font_name = 'font5x8.bin')
```

You should now be able to see the ePaper screen updating. Congratulation! If you feel more like a proâ€™ this is now the time for the next examples.
